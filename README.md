Algo Toolbox
============

Algorithm toolbox for recreational programming.

The main purpose of this toolbox is to have an easy-to-use set of functions and modules when there is a fun problem to solve or something to experiment with.

Can be useful for:

- MathsJam events
- Google Code Jam
- Other competitive programming problems, although time and memory constraints might be too tight for this toolbox to be helpful
